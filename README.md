# Summer project

For your summer project, we would like you to create a C# GUI for the pizza project that you worked through in Python.
([here](https://github.com/iAverages/college-pizza-project))

## Requirements

Write a program to handle telephone delivery orders for a downtown pizzeria.

The application must:

-   Record the customer’s name, address and telephone number
-   Record details of the pizza order from a set menu (see menu below)
-   Limit the customer to a maximum of 20 pizzas per order
-   Summarise the customer’s order, including all pizza orders, the price of each pizza, the - total cost of the order and
    details of any delivery charges
-   Use appropriate validation techniques to limit data entry errors by the user

Extension (not mandatory)

-   Store details of ALL orders in a file
-   Allow the owner to produce a list of ALL orders taken during the day and week.

## Pizza Menu

Pizzas are made with tomato and fresh mozzarella cheese base. All pizzas consist of 16 slices.

-   Cheese & Tomato - Italian-style six-cheese blend - £7.50
-   BBQ Chicken - Chargrilled chicken, barbeque sauce, bacon, onions - £7.90
-   Meat Feast - Ham, pepperoni, sausage, bacon, spicy beef - £8.10
-   Piri-Piri Chicken - Chilli pepper sauce, chargrilled chicken - £8.80
-   Hawaii - Ham, pineapple, mushrooms - £8.90
-   Mediterranean - Chorizo, Italian-style sausage, jalapeno sausage - £9.50
-   The Mexican - Jalapeno peppers, red peppers, spicy beef, onions - £9.70
-   The Works - Pepperoni, sausage, ham, mushrooms, green peppers - £9.90

> Special discount: 20% off any order over £20.

> Minimum order is £9.50, or a delivery charge of £1.50 is added.

Things to consider in your design:

-   There are 8 pizza types, so you could have a button for each pizza or a drop-down box
-   Use a list view to show all selected pizzas
-   As you are learning a new language, keep it simple, like the example below. Start by creating the buttons without any
    functionality
